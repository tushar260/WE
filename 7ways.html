	<h1>7 WAYS WOMEN COULD CHANGE THE WORLD</h1>
	</section>
	<br>
	<h3><ol>
	<li><b>They should have equal employment; women could raise every country’s GDP.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>Each country’s GDP grows by 3 percent for every additional 10 percent of girls going to school.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>If companies put women in leadership positions, both would benefit.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>Evidence suggests that gender-mixed leadership actually translates into better profits.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><b>If women were more politically involved, there would be better policies for the poor.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>In female-dominated groups, more generous economic policy choices were made, as shown in a study.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<li><b>Women should be paid more; it would help families thrive.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>Women are increasingly becoming primary, or co-breadwinners for their families, hence their pay becomes vital for the well-being of the family.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<li><b>If more women held political offices, they’d advance more pro-women policies.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>When women achieve parity in group situations, they accurately represent the interests of women and influence their male colleagues to agree with them — but when they hold a small minority, they don’t.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<li><b>Women should have more STEM training; they could change the tech market.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>Science Technology Engineering Mathematics, 1 or these play a pretty important role.</i></h5>
	</li>
	<li><b>More political power, might lead to less government corruption.</b>
	<br>
	<h5><i>Because women have been participating in politics for less time, they’re not yet accustomed to engaging in the risky political bargaining that corrupt male leaders practice.</i></h5>
	</li>
