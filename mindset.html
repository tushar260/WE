<h1>NOT WOMEN, MINDSETS NEED EMPOWERMENT</h1>
</section>
<br>
<h4>
<p>It is a very fascinating fact that India is the biggest functioning parliamentary democracy. Within 68 years of independence, it has climbed up on the charts of economies and currently stands in top 5 economies of the world. It has third largest and fifth strongest army in the world. But an even more astonishing fact is that majority of it’s women population continues to be in shackles. And this is the very reason why India lags behind super developed nations like USA, France. Thus our very concept of development is faulty.</p>

<p>After 68 years of independence, as per the census 2011, India enjoys a sex ratio of 945 women per 1000 men, with Delhi and Haryana having the worst. For a population of 1210 million people, it is a huge gap that India has maintained. The situation is even worse when it comes to higher education. Consequently, there are less number of working women in India, a serious setback for a country known for it’s human resource. Apart from that, women in India have to counter the stereotypical society and it’s atrocities. Dowry deaths, domestic violence, honor killing and frequent pregnancies have been the reasons behind early deaths. Women in India are expected to obey and abide by the laws that society has set as per their desires. Such is the helplessness of women.
Access to pornography and urbanization has made the life of a woman even more torturous. Girls have now become the target of sexual crimes and offenses. This is very shameful for a civilization known for it’s moral values and rationality.</p>

<p>Hence, Indian women are emotionally very brave to withstand such a society. In it’s true sense , Indian women don’t need empowerment . Instead, the mindset of our society needs empowerment. Once this empowerment takes place, women empowerment would be it’s corollary.</p>
